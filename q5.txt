1. Does the change inside increment_int_a change the variable a after the function call?
Answer: The value does not change when you call the function increment_int_a
because the function is called as a call by value. So, when the function is called a copy 
of variable a will be passed to function and the changes will be done to that copy which will
not reflect to the original variable a.

2. Does the change inside increment_int_b change the variable b after the function call?
Answer: The value changes when the function is called because when a mutable object is 
passed to a function it is passed as a call by reference which means the value pass to
the function will reference to the same location of original object hence changes made 
inside the function will also change the original object.
